'''The aim of Dice Rolling Game is for a player to roll 2-6 dice multiple times in each game. 
Victory is achieved when the median value is the same as the mean value in a result list of the dice rolls for all rounds of the game.
The game starts by letting the player choose a number of dice to play with and also choose the type of dice that they want to use. 
Playerâ€™s roll the dice multiple times, and based on the results, either win or lose.
Your task is to write functions to display the main menu, a game menu, as well as other functionalities to check the game history and the win/lose status.'''
